Hello everyone,

This is my take on the binary classification of determining employees who are at a risk of termination or not.

It is a Binary Classification Problem. The tools used are:

- Pandas for data manipulation and ingestion

- Numpy for multidimensional array computing

- Matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization

- Word Cloud for geeting the most populare string

- Imblearn for oversampling of the model

- Scikit Learn for Data Preprocessing
